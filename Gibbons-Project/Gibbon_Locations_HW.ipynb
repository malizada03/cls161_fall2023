      "Their Wars with the Empire and City of Constantinople\n",
      " Superstition of Andronicus and the times, A.D. 1282-1320\n",
      " The long reign of Andronicus (1) the elder is chiefly memorable by the disputes of the Greek church, the invasion of the Catalans, and the rise of the Ottoman power. He is celebrated as the most learned and virtuous prince of the age; but such virtue, and such learning, contributed neither to the perfection of the individual, nor to the happiness of society A slave of the most abject superstition, he was surrounded on all sides by visible and invisible enemies; nor were the flames of hell less dreadful to his fancy, than those of a Catalan or Turkish war. Under the reign of the Palaeologi, the choice of the patriarch was the most important business of the state; the heads of the Greek church were ambitious and fanatic monks; and their vices or virtues, their learning or ignorance, were equally mischievous or contemptible. By his intemperate discipline, the patriarch Athanasius (2) excited the hatred of the clergy and people: he was heard to declare, that the sinner should swallow the last dregs of the cup of penance; and the foolish tale was propagated of his punishing a sacrilegious ass that had tasted the lettuce of a convent garden. Driven from the throne by the universal clamour, Athanasius composed before his retreat two papers of a very opposite cast. His public testament was in the tone of charity and resignation; the private codicil breathed the direst anathemas against the authors of his disgrace, whom he excluded forever from the communion of the holy trinity, the angels, and the saints. This last paper he enclosed in an earthen pot, which was placed, by his order, on the top of one of the pillars, in the dome of St. Sophia, in the distant hope of discovery and revenge. At the end of four years, some youths, climbing by a ladder in search of pigeons' nests, detected the fatal secret; and, as Andronicus felt himself touched and bound by the excommunication, he trembled on the brink of the abyss which had been so treacherously dug under his feet. A synod of bishops was instantly convened to debate this important question: the rashness of these clandestine anathemas was generally condemned; but as the knot could be untied only by the same hand, as that hand was now deprived of the crosier, it appeared that this posthumous decree was irrevocable by any earthly power. Some faint testimonies of repentance and pardon were extorted from the author of the mischief; but the conscience of the emperor was still wounded, and he desired, with no less ardour than Athanasius himself, the restoration of a patriarch, by whom alone he could be healed. At the dead of night, a monk rudely knocked at the door of the royal bed-chamber, announcing a revelation of plague and famine,\n",
      " of inundations and earthquakes. Andronicus started from his bed, and spent the night in prayer, till he felt, or thought\n",
      " that he felt, a slight motion of the earth. The emperor on\n",
      " foot led the bishops and monks to the cell of Athanasius;\n",
      " and, after a proper resistance, the saint, from whom this\n",
      " message had been sent, consented to absolve the prince, and\n",
      " govern the church of Constantinople. Untamed by disgrace,\n",
      " and hardened by solitude, the shepherd was again odious to\n",
      " the flock, and his enemies contrived a singular, and as it\n",
      " proved, a successful, mode of revenge. In the night, they\n",
      " stole away the footstool or foot-cloth of his throne, which\n",
      " they secretly replaced with the decoration of a satirical\n",
      " picture. The emperor was painted with a bridle in his mouth,\n",
      " and Athanasius leading the tractable beast to the feet of\n",
      " Christ. The authors of the libel were detected and punished;\n",
      " but as their lives had been spared, the Christian priest in\n",
      " sullen indignation retired to his cell; and the eyes of\n",
      " Andronicus, which had been opened for a moment, were again\n",
      " closed by his successor.\n",
      "\n",
      "  If this transaction be one of the most curious and important\n",
      " of a reign of fifty years, I cannot at least accuse the\n",
      " brevity of my materials, since I reduce into some few pages\n",
      " the enormous folios of Pachymer, (3) Cantacuzene, (4) and\n",
      " Nicephorus Gregoras, (5) who have composed the prolix and\n",
      " languid story of the times. The name and situation of the\n",
      " emperor John Cantacuzene might inspire the most lively\n",
      " curiosity. His memorials of forty years extend from the\n",

      " he was the principal actor in the scenes which he describes.\n",
      " But in this eloquent work we should vainly seek the\n",
      " sincerity of a hero or a penitent. Retired in a cloister\n",
      " from the vices and passions of the world, he presents not a\n",
      " confession, but an apology, of the life of an ambitious\n",
      " statesman. Instead of unfolding the true counsels and\n",
      " characters of men, he displays the smooth and specious\n",
      " surface of events, highly varnished with his own praises and\n",
      " those of his friends. Their motives are always pure; their\n",
      " ends always legitimate: they conspire and rebel without any\n",
      " views of interest; and the violence which they inflict or\n",
      " suffer is celebrated as the spontaneous effect of reason and\n",
      " virtue.\n",
      "\n",
      " First disputes between the elder and the younger Andronicus, A.D. 1320.\n",
      " After the example of the first of the Palaeologi, the elder\n",
      " Andronicus associated his son Michael to the honours of the\n",
      " purple; and from the age of eighteen to his premature death,\n",
      " that prince was acknowledged, above twenty- five years, as\n",
      " the second emperor of the Greeks. (6) At the head of an army,\n",
      " he excited neither the fears of the enemy, nor the jealousy\n",
      " of the court; his modesty and patience were never tempted to\n",
      " compute the years of his father; nor was that father\n",
      " compelled to repent of his liberality either by the virtues\n",
      " or vices of his son. The son of Michael was named Andronicus\n",
      " from his grandfather, to whose early favour he was introduced\n",
      " by that nominal resemblance. The blossoms of wit and beauty\n",
      " increased the fondness of the elder Andronicus; and, with\n",
      " the common vanity of age, he expected to realize in the\n",
      " second, the hope which had been disappointed in the first,\n",
      " generation. The boy was educated in the palace as an heir\n",
      " and a favourite; and in the oaths and acclamations of the\n",
      " people, the august triad was formed by the names of the\n",
      " father, the son, and the grandson. But the younger\n",
      " Andronicus was speedily corrupted by his infant greatness,\n",
      " while he beheld with puerile impatience the double obstacle\n",
      " that hung, and might long hang, over his rising ambition.\n",
      " It was not to acquire fame, or to diffuse happiness, that he\n",
      " so eagerly aspired: wealth and impunity were in his eyes the\n",
      " most precious attributes of a monarch; and his first\n",
      " indiscreet demand was the sovereignty of some rich and\n",
      " fertile island, where he might lead a life of independence\n",
      " and pleasure. The emperor was offended by the loud and\n",
      " frequent intemperance which disturbed his capital; the sums\n",
      " which his parsimony denied were supplied by the Genoese\n",
      " usurers of Pera; and the oppressive debt, which consolidated\n",
      " the interest of a faction, could be discharged only by a\n",
      " revolution. A beautiful female, a matron in rank, a\n",
      " prostitute in manners, had instructed the younger Andronicus\n",
      " in the rudiments of love; but he had reason to suspect the\n",
      " nocturnal visits of a rival; and a stranger passing through\n",
      " the street was pierced by the arrows of his guards, who were\n",
      " placed in ambush at her door. That stranger was his brother,\n",
      " Prince Manuel, who languished and died of his wound; and the\n",
      " emperor Michael, their common father, whose health was in a\n",
      " declining state, expired on the eighth day, lamenting the\n",
      " loss of both his children. (7) However guiltless in his\n",
      " intention, the younger Andronicus might impute a brother's\n",
      " and a father's death to the consequence of his own vices;\n",
      " and deep was the sigh of thinking and feeling men, when they\n",
      " perceived, instead of sorrow and repentance, his\n",
      " ill-dissembled joy on the removal of two odious competitors.\n",
      " By these melancholy events, and the increase of his\n",
      " disorders, the mind of the elder emperor was gradually\n",
      " alienated; and, after many fruitless reproofs, he\n",
      " transferred on another grandson (8) his hopes and affection.\n",
      " The change was announced by the new oath of allegiance to\n",
      " the reigning sovereign, and the person whom he should\n",
      " appoint for his successor; and the acknowledged heir, after\n",
      " a repetition of insults and complaints, was exposed to the\n",
      " indignity of a public trial. Before the sentence, which\n",
      " would probably have condemned him to a dungeon or a cell,\n",
      " the emperor was informed that the palace courts were filled\n",
      " with the armed followers of his grandson; the judgment was\n",
      " softened to a treaty of reconciliation; and the triumphant\n",
      " escape of the prince encouraged the ardour of the younger\n",
      " faction.\n",
      " Three civil wars between the two emperors, A.D. 1321, April 20-A.D. 1328, May 24..\n",
      " Yet the capital, the clergy, and the senate, adhered to the\n",
      " person, or at least to the government, of the old emperor;\n",
      " and it was only in the provinces, by flight, and revolt, and\n",
      " foreign succour, that the malcontents could hope to\n",
      " vindicate their cause and subvert his throne. The soul of\n",
      " the enterprise was the great domestic John Cantacuzene; the\n",
      " sally from Constantinople is the first date of his actions\n",
      " and memorials; and if his own pen be most descriptive of his\n",
      " patriotism, an unfriendly historian has not refused to\n",
      " celebrate the zeal and ability which he displayed in the\n",
      " service of the young emperor. That prince escaped from the\n",
      " capital under the pretence of hunting; erected his standard\n",
      " at Adrianople; and, in a few days, assembled fifty thousand\n",
      " horse and foot, whom neither honour nor duty could have armed\n",
      " against the Barbarians. Such a force might have saved or\n",
      " commanded the empire; but their counsels were discordant,\n",
      " their motions were slow and doubtful, and their progress was checked by intrigue and negotiation. The quarrel of the two Andronici was protracted, and suspended, and renewed, during a ruinous period of seven years. In the first treaty, the relics of the Greek empire were divided: Constantinople,\n",
      " Thessalonica, and the islands, were left to the elder, while the younger acquired the sovereignty of the greatest part of Thrace, from Philippi to the Byzantine limit. Coronation of the younger Andronicus, A.D. 1325, February 2.  By the second  treaty, he stipulated the payment of his troops, his immediate coronation, and an adequate share of the power and revenue of the state. The third civil war was terminated by the surprise of Constantinople, the final retreat of the old emperor, and the sole reign of his victorious grandson. The reasons of this delay may be found in the characters of the men and of the times. When the heir of the monarchy first pleaded his wrongs and his apprehensions, he was heard with pity and applause: and his adherents repeated on all sides the inconsistent promise, that he would increase the pay of the soldiers and alleviate the burdens of the people. The grievances of forty years were mingled in his revolt; and the rising generation was fatigued by the endless prospect of a reign, whose favourites and maxims were of other times. The youth of Andronicus had been without spirit, his age was without reverence: his taxes produced an unusual revenue of five hundred thousand pounds; yet the richest of the sovereigns of Christendom was incapable of maintaining three thousand horse and twenty galleys, to resist the destructive progress of the Turks. (9)   But the Greeks were soon admonished, that the public disorders could not be healed by a civil war; and that their young favourite was not destined to be the saviour of a falling empire. On the first repulse, his party was broken by his own levity, their intestine discord, and the intrigues of the ancient court, which tempted each malcontent to desert or betray the cause of the rebellion. Andronicus the younger was touched with remorse, or fatigued with business, or deceived by negotiation: pleasure rather than power was his aim; and the license of maintaining a thousand hounds, a thousand hawks, and a thousand huntsmen, was sufficient to sully his fame and disarm his ambition.\n",
      "\n",
      " The elder Andronicus abdicates the government, A.D. 1328, May 24.\n",
      " Let us now survey the catastrophe of this busy plot, and the\n",
      " final situation of the principal actors. (10) The age of\n",
      " Andronicus was consumed in civil discord; and, amidst the\n",
      " events of war and treaty, his power and reputation\n",
      " continually decayed, till the fatal night in which the gates\n",
      " of the city and palace were opened without resistance to his\n",
      " grandson. His principal commander scorned the repeated\n",
      " warnings of danger; and retiring to rest in the vain\n",
      " security of ignorance, abandoned the feeble monarch, with\n",
      " some priests and pages, to the terrors of a sleepless night.\n",
      " These terrors were quickly realized by the hostile shouts,\n",
      " which proclaimed the titles and victory of Andronicus the\n",
      " younger; and the aged emperor, falling prostrate before an\n",
      " image of the Virgin, despatched a suppliant message to\n",
      " resign the sceptre, and to obtain his life at the hands of\n",
      " the conqueror. The answer of his grandson was decent and\n",
      " pious; at the prayer of his friends, the younger Andronicus\n",
      " assumed the sole administration; but the elder still enjoyed\n",
      " the name and preeminence of the first emperor, the use of\n",
      " the great palace, and a pension of twenty-four thousand\n",
      " pieces of gold, one half of which was assigned on the royal\n",
      " treasury, and the other on the fishery of Constantinople.\n",
      " But his impotence was soon exposed to contempt and oblivion;\n",
      " the vast silence of the palace was disturbed only by the\n",
      " cattle and poultry of the neighbourhood,  which roved with\n",
      " impunity through the solitary courts; and a reduced\n",
      " allowance of ten thousand pieces of gold (11) was all that he\n",
      " could ask, and more than he could hope. His calamities were\n",
      " embittered by the gradual extinction of sight; his\n",
      " confinement was rendered each day more rigorous; and during\n",
      " the absence and sickness of his grandson, his inhuman\n",
      " keepers, by the threats of instant death, compelled him to\n",
      " exchange the purple for the monastic habit and profession.\n",
      " The monk Antony had renounced the pomp of the world; yet he\n",
      " had occasion for a coarse fur in the winter season, and as\n",
      " wine was forbidden by his confessor, and water by his\n",
      " physician, the sherbet of Egypt was his common drink. It\n",
      " was not without difficulty that the late emperor could\n",
      " procure three or four pieces to satisfy these simple wants;\n",
      " and if he bestowed the gold to relieve the more painful\n",
      " distress of a friend, the sacrifice is of some weight in the\n",
      " scale of humanity and religion. His death, A.D. 1332, February 13.  Four years after his\n",
      " abdication, Andronicus or Antony expired in a cell, in the\n",
      " seventy-fourth year of his age: and the last strain of\n",
      " adulation could only promise a more splendid crown of glory\n",
      " in heaven than he had enjoyed upon earth. (12)\n",

      " Nor was the reign of the younger, more glorious or fortunate\n",
      " than that of the elder, Andronicus. (13) He gathered the\n",
      " fruits of ambition; but the taste was transient and bitter:\n",
      " in the supreme station he lost the remains of his early\n",
      " popularity; and the defects of his character became still\n",
      " more conspicuous to the world. The public reproach urged\n",
      " him to march in person against the Turks; nor did his\n",
      " courage fail in the hour of trial; but a defeat and a wound\n",
      " were the only trophies of his expedition in Asia, which\n",
      " confirmed the establishment of the Ottoman monarchy. The\n",
      " abuses of the civil government attained their full maturity\n",
      " and perfection: his neglect of forms, and the confusion of\n",
      " national dresses, are deplored by the Greeks as the fatal\n",
      " symptoms of the decay of the empire. Andronicus was old\n",
      " before his time; the intemperance of youth had accelerated\n",

      " year. His two wives. He was twice married; and, as the progress of the Latins in arms and arts had softened the prejudices of the\n",
      " Byzantine court, his two wives were chosen in the princely\n",
      " houses of Germany and Italy. The first, Agnes at home,\n",
      " Irene in Greece, was daughter of the duke of Brunswick. Her\n",

      " obedience to the great domestic; and the leaders of the troops and provinces were induced, by their private interest, to prefer the loose dominion of a woman and a priest.  The army of Cantacuzene, in sixteen divisions, was stationed on the banks of the Melas to tempt or to\n",

      " justly alarmed by a petition of the friends of Cantacuzene,\n",
      " that they might be released from their oath of allegiance to\n",

      " cautionary towns; a measure supported with argument and\n",
      " eloquence; and which was rejected (says the Imperial\n",
      " historian) \"by my sublime, and almost incredible virtue.\"   His repose was disturbed by the sound of plots and\n",
      " seditions; and he trembled lest the lawful prince should be\n",
      " stolen away by some foreign or domestic enemy, who would\n",
      " inscribe his name and his wrongs in the banners of\n",
      " rebellion. As the son of Andronicus advanced in the years\n",
      " of manhood, he began to feel and to act for himself; and his\n",
      " rising ambition was rather stimulated than checked by the\n",
      " imitation of his father's vices. If we may trust his own\n",
      " professions, Cantacuzene labored with honest industry to\n",
      " correct these sordid and sensual appetites, and to raise the\n",
      " mind of the young prince to a level with his fortune. In\n",
      " the Servian expedition, the two emperors showed themselves\n",
      " in cordial harmony to the troops and provinces; and the\n",
      " younger colleague was initiated by the elder in the\n",
      " mysteries of war and government. After the conclusion of\n",
      " the peace, Palaeologus was left at Thessalonica, a royal\n",
      " residence, and a frontier station, to secure by his absence\n",
      " the peace of Constantinople, and to withdraw his youth from\n",
      " the temptations of a luxurious capital. But the distance\n",
      " weakened the powers of control, and the son of Andronicus\n",
      " was surrounded with artful or unthinking companions, who\n",
      " taught him to hate his guardian, to deplore his exile, and\n",
      " to vindicate his rights. A private treaty with the cral or\n",
      " despot of Servia was soon followed by an open revolt; and\n",
      " Cantacuzene, on the throne of the elder Andronicus, defended\n",
      " the cause of age and prerogative, which in his youth he had\n",
      " so vigorously attacked. At his request the empress-mother\n",
      " undertook the voyage of Thessalonica, and the office of\n",
      " mediation: she returned without success; and unless Anne of\n",
      " Savoy was instructed by adversity, we may doubt the\n",
      " sincerity, or at least the fervour, of her zeal. While the\n",
      " regent grasped the sceptre with a firm and vigorous hand,\n",
      " she had been instructed to declare, that the ten years of\n",
      " his legal administration would soon elapse; and that, after\n",
      " a full trial of the vanity of the world, the emperor\n",
      " Cantacuzene sighed for the repose of a cloister, and was\n",
      " ambitious only of a heavenly crown. Had these sentiments\n",
      " been genuine, his voluntary abdication would have restored\n",
      " the peace of the empire, and his conscience would have been\n",
      " relieved by an act of justice. Palaeologus alone was\n",
      " responsible for his future government; and whatever might be\n",
      " his vices, they were surely less formidable than the\n",
      " calamities of a civil war, in which the Barbarians and\n",
      " infidels were again invited to assist the Greeks in their\n",
      " mutual destruction. John Palaeologus takes up arms against him, A.D. 1353.  By the arms of the Turks, who now struck\n",
      " a deep and everlasting root in Europe, Cantacuzene prevailed\n",
      " in the third contest in which he had been involved; and the\n",
      " young emperor, driven from the sea and land, was compelled\n",
      " to take shelter among the Latins of the Isle of Tenedos.\n",
      " His insolence and obstinacy provoked the victor to a step\n",
      " which must render the quarrel irreconcilable; and the\n",

      " purple, established the succession in the family of the\n",
      " Cantacuzeni. But Constantinople was still attached to the blood of her ancient princes; and this last injury accelerated the restoration of the rightful heir. A noble Genoese espoused the cause of Palaeologus, obtained a\n",
      " promise of his sister, and achieved the revolution with two galleys and two thousand five hundred auxiliaries. Under the pretence of distress, they were admitted into the lesser port; a gate was opened, and the Latin shout of, \"Long life and victory to the emperor, John Palaeologus!\"   was answered by a general rising in his favour. A numerous and loyal party yet adhered to the standard of Cantacuzene: but he asserts in his history (does he hope for belief?) that his tender conscience rejected the assurance of conquest; that, in free obedience to the voice of religion and philosophy, he descended from the throne and embraced with pleasure the monastic habit and profession. (36) So soon as he ceased to be a prince, his successor was not unwilling that he should be a saint: the remainder of his life was devoted to piety and learning; Abdication of Cantacuzene,A.D. 1335,January.  in the cells of Constantinople and Mount Athos, the monk Joasaph was respected as the temporal and spiritual father of the emperor; and if he issued from his retreat, it was as the minister of peace, to subdue the obstinacy, and solicit the pardon, of his rebellious son.\n",

      " he defended with equal zeal the divine light of Mount\n",

      " abbot, who flourished in the eleventh century.  This light, the production of a distempered fancy, the creature of an empty stomach and an empty brain, was adored by the Quietists as the pure and perfect essence of God himself; and as long as the folly was confined to Mount Athos, the simple solitaries were not inquisitive how the divine essence could be a material substance, or how an immaterial substance could be perceived by the eyes of the body. But in the reign of the younger Andronicus, these monasteries were visited by Barlaam, (41) a Calabrian monk, who was equally skilled in philosophy and theology; who possessed the language of the Greeks and Latins; and whose versatile genius could maintain their opposite creeds, according to the interest of the moment. The indiscretion of an ascetic revealed to the curious traveller the secrets of mental prayer and Barlaam embraced the opportunity of ridiculing the Quietists, who placed the soul in the navel; of accusing the monks of Mount Athos of heresy and blasphemy. His attack compelled the more learned to renounce or dissemble the simple devotion of their brethren; and Gregory Palamas introduced a scholastic distinction between the essence and operation of God. His inaccessible essence dwells in the midst of an uncreated and eternal light; and this beatific vision of the saints had been manifested to the disciples on Mount Thabor, in the transfiguration of Christ. Yet this distinction could not\n",
      " escape the reproach of polytheism; the eternity of the light\n",
      " of Thabor was fiercely denied; and Barlaam still charged the\n",
      " Palamites with holding two eternal substances, a visible and\n",
      " an invisible God. From the rage of the monks of Mount\n",
      " Athos, who threatened his life, the Calabrian retired to\n",
      " Constantinople, where his smooth and specious manners\n",
      " introduced him to the favour of the great domestic and the\n",
      " emperor. The court and the city were involved in this\n",
      " theological dispute, which flamed amidst the civil war; but\n",
      " the doctrine of Barlaam was disgraced by his flight and\n",
      " apostasy: the Palamites triumphed; and their adversary, the\n",
      " patriarch John of Apri, was deposed by the consent of the\n",
      " adverse factions of the state. In the character of emperor\n",
      " and theologian, Cantacuzene presided in the synod of the\n",
      " Greek church, which established, as an article of faith, the\n",
      " uncreated light of Mount Thabor; and, after so many insults,\n",
      " the reason of mankind was slightly wounded by the addition\n",
      " of a single absurdity. Many rolls of paper or parchment\n",
      " have been blotted; and the impenitent sectaries, who refused\n",
      " to subscribe the orthodox creed, were deprived of the honours\n",
      " of Christian burial; but in the next age the question was\n",
      " forgotten; nor can I learn that the axe or the faggot were\n",
      " employed for the extirpation of the Barlaamite heresy. (42)\n",

      " For the conclusion of this chapter, I have reserved the\n",
      " Genoese war, which shook the throne of Cantacuzene, and\n",
      " betrayed the debility of the Greek empire. The Genoese,\n",
      " who, after the recovery of Constantinople, were seated in\n",
      " the suburb of Pera or Galata, received that honourable fief\n",
      " from the bounty of the emperor. They were indulged in the\n",
      " use of their laws and magistrates; but they submitted to the\n",
      " duties of vassals and subjects; the forcible word of\n",
      " liegemen (43) was borrowed from the Latin jurisprudence; and their podesta, or chief, before he entered on his office,\n",
      " saluted the emperor with loyal acclamations and vows of\n",
      " fidelity. Genoa sealed a firm alliance with the Greeks;\n",
      " and, in case of a defensive war, a supply of fifty empty\n",
      " galleys and a succour of fifty galleys, completely armed and\n",
      " manned, was promised by the republic to the empire. In the\n",
      " revival of a naval force, it was the aim of Michael\n",
      " Palaeologus to deliver himself from a foreign aid; and his\n",
      " vigorous government contained the Genoese of Galata within\n",
      " those limits which the insolence of wealth and freedom\n",
      " provoked them to exceed. A sailor threatened that they\n",
      " should soon be masters of Constantinople, and slew the Greek\n",
      " who resented this national affront; and an armed vessel,\n",
      " after refusing to salute the palace, was guilty of some acts\n",
      " of piracy in the Black Sea. Their countrymen threatened to\n",
      " support their cause; but the long and open village of Galata\n",
      " was instantly surrounded by the Imperial troops; till, in\n",
      " the moment of the assault, the prostrate Genoese implored\n",
      " the clemency of their sovereign. The defenceless situation\n",
      " which secured their obedience exposed them to the attack of\n",
      " their Venetian rivals, who, in the reign of the elder\n",
      " Andronicus, presumed to violate the majesty of the throne.\n",
      " On the approach of their fleets, the Genoese, with their\n",
      " families and effects, retired into the city: their empty\n",
      " habitations were reduced to ashes; and the feeble prince,\n",
      " who had viewed the destruction of his suburb, expressed his\n",
      " resentment, not by arms, but by ambassadors. This\n",
      " misfortune, however, was advantageous to the Genoese, who\n",
      " obtained, and imperceptibly abused, the dangerous license of\n",
      " surrounding Galata with a strong wall; of introducing into\n",
      " the ditch the waters of the sea; of erecting lofty turrets;\n",
      " and of mounting a train of military engines on the rampart.\n",
      " The narrow bounds in which they had been circumscribed were\n",
      " insufficient for the growing colony; each day they acquired\n",
      " some addition of landed property; and the adjacent hills\n",
      " were covered with their villas and castles, which they\n",
      " joined and protected by new fortifications. (44) The\n",
      " navigation and trade of the Euxine was the patrimony of the\n",
      " Greek emperors, who commanded the narrow entrance, the\n",
      " gates, as it were, of that inland sea. In the reign of\n",
      " Michael Palaeologus, their prerogative was acknowledged by\n",
      " the sultan of Egypt, who solicited and obtained the liberty\n",
      " of sending an annual ship for the purchase of slaves in\n",
      " Circassia and the Lesser Tartary: Their trade and insolence.  a liberty pregnant with mischief to the Christian cause; since these youths were transformed by education and discipline into the formidable\n",
      " Mamalukes. (45) From the colony of Pera, the Genoese engaged\n",
      " with superior advantage in the lucrative trade of the Black\n",
      " Sea; and their industry supplied the Greeks with fish and\n",
      " corn; two articles of food almost equally important to a\n",
      " superstitious people. The spontaneous bounty of nature\n",
      " appears to have bestowed the harvests of Ukraine, the\n",
      " produce of a rude and savage husbandry; and the endless\n",
      " exportation of salt fish and caviare is annually renewed by\n",
      " the enormous sturgeons that are caught at the mouth of the\n",
      " Don or Tanais, in their last station of the rich mud and\n",
      " shallow water of the Maeotis. (46) The waters of the Oxus,\n",
      " the Caspian, the Volga, and the Don, opened a rare and\n",
      " laborious passage for the gems and spices of India; and\n",
      " after three months' march the caravans of Carizme met the\n",
      " Italian vessels in the harbours of Crimaea. (47) These various\n",
      " branches of trade were monopolized by the diligence and\n",
      " power of the Genoese. Their rivals of Venice and Pisa were\n",
      " forcibly expelled; the natives were awed by the castles and\n",
      " cities, which arose on the foundations of their humble\n",
      " factories; and their principal establishment of Caffa (48)\n",
      " was besieged without effect by the Tartar powers. Destitute\n",
      " of a navy, the Greeks were oppressed by these haughty\n",
      " merchants, who fed, or famished, Constantinople, according\n",
      " to their interest. They proceeded to usurp the customs, the\n",
      " fishery, and even the toll, of the Bosphorus; and while they\n",
      " derived from these objects a revenue of two hundred thousand\n",
      " pieces of gold, a remnant of thirty thousand was reluctantly\n",
      " allowed to the emperor. (49) The colony of Pera or Galata\n",
      " acted, in peace and war, as an independent state; and, as it\n",
      " will happen in distant settlements, the Genoese podesta too\n",
      " often forgot that he was the servant of his own masters.\n",

      " Their war with the emperor Cantacuzene, A.D. 1348.\n",
      " These usurpations were encouraged by the weakness of the\n",
      " elder Andronicus, and by the civil wars that afflicted his\n",
      " age and the minority of his grandson. The talents of\n",
      " Cantacuzene were employed to the ruin, rather than the\n",
      " restoration, of the empire; and after his domestic victory,\n",
      " he was condemned to an ignominious trial, whether the Greeks\n",
      " or the Genoese should reign in Constantinople. The\n",
      " merchants of Pera were offended by his refusal of some\n",
      " contiguous land, some commanding heights, which they\n",
      " proposed to cover with new fortifications; and in the\n",
      " absence of the emperor, who was detained at Demotica by\n",
      " sickness, they ventured to brave the debility of a female\n",
      " reign. A Byzantine vessel, which had presumed to fish at the\n",
      " mouth of the harbour, was sunk by these audacious strangers;\n",
      " the fishermen were murdered. Instead of suing for pardon,\n",
      " the Genoese demanded satisfaction; required, in a haughty\n",
      " strain, that the Greeks should renounce the exercise of\n",
      " navigation; and encountered with regular arms the first\n",
      " sallies of the popular indignation. They instantly occupied\n",
      " the debatable land; and by the labor of a whole people, of\n",
      " either sex and of every age, the wall was raised, and the\n",
      " ditch was sunk, with incredible speed. At the same time,\n",
      " they attacked and burnt two Byzantine galleys; while the\n",
      " three others, the remainder of the Imperial navy, escaped\n",
      " from their hands: the habitations without the gates, or\n",
      " along the shore, were pillaged and destroyed; and the care\n",
      " of the regent, of the empress Irene, was confined to the\n",
      " preservation of the city. The return of Cantacuzene\n",
      " dispelled the public consternation: the emperor inclined to\n",
      " peaceful counsels; but he yielded to the obstinacy of his\n",
      " enemies, who rejected all reasonable terms, and to the ardour\n",
      " of his subjects, who threatened, in the style of Scripture,\n",
      " to break them in pieces like a potter's vessel. Yet they\n",
      " reluctantly paid the taxes, that he imposed for the\n",
      " construction of ships, and the expenses of the war; and as\n",
      " the two nations were masters, the one of the land, the other\n",
      " of the sea, Constantinople and Pera were pressed by the\n",
      " evils of a mutual siege. The merchants of the colony, who\n",
      " had believed that a few days would terminate the war,\n",
      " already murmured at their losses: the succours from their\n",
      " mother-country were delayed by the factions of Genoa; and\n",
      " the most cautious embraced the opportunity of a Rhodian\n",
      " vessel to remove their families and effects from the scene\n",
      " of hostility. Destruction of his fleet, A.D. 1349.  In the spring, the Byzantine fleet, seven\n",
      " galleys and a train of smaller vessels, issued from the\n",
      " mouth of the harbour, and steered in a single line along the\n",
      " shore of Pera; unskilfully presenting their sides to the\n",
      " beaks of the adverse squadron. The crews were composed of\n",
      " peasants and mechanics; nor was their ignorance compensated\n",
      " by the native courage of Barbarians: the wind was strong,\n",
      " the waves were rough; and no sooner did the Greeks perceive\n",
      " a distant and inactive enemy, than they leaped headlong into\n",
      " the sea, from a doubtful, to an inevitable peril. The troops\n",
      " that marched to the attack of the lines of Pera were struck\n",
      " at the same moment with a similar panic; and the Genoese\n",
      " were astonished, and almost ashamed, at their double\n",
      " victory. Their triumphant vessels, crowned with flowers, and\n",
      " dragging after them the captive galleys, repeatedly passed\n",
      " and repassed before the palace: the only virtue of the\n",
      " emperor was patience; and the hope of revenge his sole\n",
      " consolation. Yet the distress of both parties interposed a\n",
      " temporary agreement; and the shame of the empire was\n",
      " disguised by a thin veil of dignity and power. Summoning the\n",
      " chiefs of the colony, Cantacuzene affected to despise the\n",
      " trivial object of the debate; and, after a mild reproof,\n",
      " most liberally granted the lands, which had been previously\n",
      " resigned to the seeming custody of his officers. (50)\n",
      " Victory of the Genoese over the Venetians and Greeks, A.D. 1352, February 13.\n",
      " But the emperor was soon solicited to violate the treaty,\n",
      " and to join his arms with the Venetians, the perpetual\n",
      " enemies of Genoa and her colonies. While he compared the\n",
      " reasons of peace and war, his moderation was provoked by a\n",
      " wanton insult of the inhabitants of Pera, who discharged\n",
      " from their rampart a large stone that fell in the midst of\n",
      " Constantinople. On his just complaint, they coldly blamed\n",
      " the imprudence of their engineer; but the next day the\n",
      " insult was repeated; and they exulted in a second proof that\n",
      " the royal city was not beyond the reach of their artillery.\n",
      " Cantacuzene instantly signed his treaty with the Venetians;\n",
      " but the weight of the Roman empire was scarcely felt in the\n",
      " balance of these opulent and powerful republics. (51) From\n",
      " the Straits of Gibraltar to the mouth of the Tanais, their\n",
      " fleets encountered each other with various success; and a\n",
      " memorable battle was fought in the narrow sea, under the\n",
      " walls of Constantinople. It would not be an easy task to\n",
      " reconcile the accounts of the Greeks, the Venetians, and the\n",
      " Genoese; (52) and while I depend on the narrative of an\n",
      " impartial historian, (53) I shall borrow from each nation the\n",
      " facts that redound to their own disgrace, and the honour of\n",
      " their foes. The Venetians, with their allies the Catalans,\n",
      " had the advantage of number; and their fleet, with the poor\n",
      " addition of eight Byzantine galleys, amounted to\n",
      " seventy-five sail: the Genoese did not exceed sixty-four;\n",
      " but in those times their ships of war were distinguished by\n",
      " the superiority of their size and strength. The names and\n",
      " families of their naval commanders, Pisani and Doria, are\n",
      " illustrious in the annals of their country; but the personal\n",
      " merit of the former was eclipsed by the fame and abilities\n",
      " of his rival. They engaged in tempestuous weather; and the\n",
      " tumultuary conflict was continued from the dawn to the\n",
      " extinction of light. The enemies of the Genoese applaud\n",
      " their prowess; the friends of the Venetians are dissatisfied\n",
      " with their behaviour; but all parties agree in praising the\n",
      " skill and boldness of the Catalans,  who, with many\n",
      " wounds, sustained the brunt of the action. On the separation\n",
      " of the fleets, the event might appear doubtful; but the\n",
      " thirteen Genoese galleys, that had been sunk or taken, were\n",
      " compensated by a double loss of the allies; of fourteen\n",
      " Venetians, ten Catalans, and two Greeks;  and even the\n",
      " grief of the conquerors expressed the assurance and habit of\n",
      " more decisive victories. Pisani confessed his defeat, by\n",
      " retiring into a fortified harbour, from whence, under the\n",
      " pretext of the orders of the senate, he steered with a\n",
      " broken and flying squadron for the Isle of Candia, and\n",
      " abandoned to his rivals the sovereignty of the sea. In a\n",
      " public epistle, (54) addressed to the doge and senate,\n",
      " Petrarch employs his eloquence to reconcile the maritime powers, the two luminaries of Italy. The orator celebrates the valour and victory of the Genoese, the first of men in the exercise of naval war: he drops a tear on the misfortunes of their Venetian brethren; but he exhorts them to pursue with fire and sword the base and perfidious Greeks; to purge the metropolis of the East from the heresy with which it was infected. Their treaty with the empire, May 6.  Deserted by their friends, the Greeks were incapable of resistance; and three months after the battle, the emperor Cantacuzene solicited and subscribed a treaty, which forever banished the Venetians and Catalans, and granted to the Genoese a monopoly of trade, and almost a right of dominion. The Roman empire (I smile in transcribing the name) might soon have sunk into a province of Genoa, if the ambition of the republic had not been checked by the ruin of her freedom and naval power. A long contest of one hundred and thirty years was determined by the triumph of Venice; and the factions of the Genoese compelled them to seek for domestic peace under the protection of a foreign lord, the duke of Milan, or the French king. Yet the spirit of commerce survived that of conquest; and the colony of Pera still awed the capital and navigated the Euxine, till it was involved by the Turks in the final servitude of Constantinople itself.\n"
